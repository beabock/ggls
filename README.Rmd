# ggls

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ggls is to add letter indicating the significance of differences of results among treatments displayed in ggplot barplots and boxplots.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggls from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("beabock/ggls")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggls)
## basic example code
```


You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
