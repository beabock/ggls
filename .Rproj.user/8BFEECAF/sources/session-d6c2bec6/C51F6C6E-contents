The idea of this package is to add letters indicating significance above compared bars in barplots. However, that seems hard, so this does some other, easier things.

First, you can use the comparison_maker to create a list which you can feed into the ggpubr package. That package requires you to make a list of all the comparisons you wish to do, and comparison_maker creates the list assuming you want to compare each group to each other group.

Second, you can use the assumption tester to test your dataset for the common assumptions of statistical tests, including normal distribution and equality of variances.
