If you've ever used the `ggpubr` package before, you know that you have to make a list of all the comparisons you're going to make on the plot, which is annoying. This fancy function does all the work for you!

Let's try it out.

```{r setup, warning = F}
library(ggls)
```

```{r}
supps <- comparison_maker(ToothGrowth, supp)
print(supps)
```

Now we have a list of the comparisons we want `ggpubr` to make. Yay. Now we can plug this in to our ggpubr functions.
