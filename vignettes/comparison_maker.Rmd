If you've ever used the ggpubr package before, you know that you have to make a list of all the comparisons you're going to make on the plot, which is annoying. This fancy function does all the work for you!

Let's try it out.

```{r}
comparison_maker(ToothGrowth, supp)

```

Now we have a "comparisons" variable with a list of the comparisons we want. Yay. Now we can plug this in to our ggpubr arguments.
